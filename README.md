## Introduction

D-FINE addresses the challenges in object detection by improving the regression tasks associated with DETRs. Traditional methods often struggle with precise localization and classification. By employing fine-grained distribution refinement, D-FINE enhances performance, making it a valuable tool for researchers and developers in the field of computer vision.

## Features

- **Improved Accuracy**: D-FINE achieves better localization and classification accuracy compared to standard DETR implementations.
- **Easy Integration**: Designed to be easily integrated into existing projects.
- **Extensive Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples to help you get started quickly.
- **Community Support**: Engage with other users and developers for assistance and collaboration.

## Installation

To get started with D-FINE, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Cobbson12gh/D-FINE.git
   cd D-FINE
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download and execute the latest release from our [Releases section](https://github.com/Cobbson12gh/D-FINE/releases). Follow the instructions in the release notes for proper setup.

## Usage

Using D-FINE is straightforward. Hereâ€™s a quick guide to get you started:

1. **Import the Library**:
   ```python
   from d_fine import DFineModel
   ```

2. **Initialize the Model**:
   ```python
   model = DFineModel()
   ```

3. **Load Your Data**: Prepare your dataset in the required format.

4. **Train the Model**:
   ```python
   model.train(data)
   ```

5. **Evaluate the Model**:
   ```python
   results = model.evaluate(test_data)
   print(results)
   ```

For more detailed usage, refer to the [documentation](#).

## Examples

To demonstrate the capabilities of D-FINE, we have included several examples:

### Example 1: Basic Object Detection

This example shows how to use D-FINE for basic object detection tasks. You can find the code in the `examples/basic_detection.py` file.

### Example 2: Fine-Grained Distribution Refinement

This example illustrates how to leverage the fine-grained distribution refinement feature. Check out `examples/fine_grained_refinement.py` for the complete code.

### Example 3: Real-World Application

Explore how D-FINE can be applied in real-world scenarios by reviewing `examples/real_world_application.py`.
